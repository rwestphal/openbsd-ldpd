.Sh NAME
.Nm ldpd.conf
.Nd Label Distribution Protocol daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ldpd 8
daemon implements the Label Distribution Protocol as described in RFC 5036.
.Sh SECTIONS
The
.Nm
config file is divided into five main sections.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr ldpd 8 .
.It Sy Interfaces Configuration
Interface-specific parameters.
.It Sy Targeted Neighbors Configuration
Targeted neighbor specific parameters.
.It Sy Neighbors Configuration
Neighbor-specific parameters.
.El
.Sh MACROS
Much like
.Xr cpp 1
or
.Xr m4 1 ,
macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic cost ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hi="2"
interface em0 {
	cost $hi
}
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
All interface related settings can be configured globally and per interface.
The only settings that can be set globally and not overruled are listed below.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic fib-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
do not update the Label Forwarding Information Base, a.k.a. the kernel routing
table.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Ic router-id Ar address
Set the router ID; in combination with labelspace it forms the LSR-ID.
.Pp
.It Ic keepalive Ar seconds
Set the keepalive timeout in seconds.
The default value is 180; valid range is 1\-65535.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic targeted-hello-accept
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
allow LDP sessions to be established with remote neighbors that have not been
specifically configured.
The default is
.Ic no .
.El
.Sh INTERFACES
Each interface can have several parameters configured individually, otherwise
they are inherited.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
interface em0 {
}
.Ed
.Pp
Interface-specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic link-hello-holdtime Ar seconds
Set the hello holdtime in seconds.
The maximum time
.Xr ldpd 8
will wait between two consecutive hello messages from a peer before it is
marked as being down.
The default value is 15.
.It Ic link-hello-interval Ar seconds
Set the hello interval in seconds.
The default value is 5; valid range is 1\-65535.
.El
.Sh TARGETED NEIGHBORS
Each targeted neighbor can have several parameters configured individually,
otherwise they are inherited.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
targeted-neighbor A.B.C.D {
}
.Ed
.Pp
Targeted-neighbor specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic targeted-hello-holdtime Ar seconds
Set the hello holdtime in seconds.
The maximum time
.Xr ldpd 8
will wait between two consecutive hello messages from a peer before it is
marked as being down.
The default value is 45.
.It Ic targeted-hello-interval Ar seconds
Set the hello interval in seconds.
The default value is 5; valid range is 1\-65535.
.El
.Sh NEIGHBORS
The
.Ic neighbor
section allows for the configuration of neighbor-specific parameters.
Note, however, that
.Xr ldpd 8
uses the hello discovery mechanism to discover its neighbors.
Without an underlying adjacency these commands have no effect.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
neighbor A.B.C.D {
}
.Ed
.Pp
Neighbor-specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic password Ar secret
Enable TCP MD5 signatures per RFC 5036.

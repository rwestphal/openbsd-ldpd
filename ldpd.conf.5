.Sh NAME
.Nm ldpd.conf
.Nd Label Distribution Protocol daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ldpd 8
daemon implements the Label Distribution Protocol as described in RFC 3036.
.Sh SECTIONS
The
.Nm
config file is divided into three main sections.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr ldpd 8 .
.It Sy Interfaces Configuration
Interface-specific parameters.
.El
.Sh MACROS
Much like
.Xr cpp 1
or
.Xr m4 1 ,
macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits,
and underscores.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic cost ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hi="2"
interface em0 {
	cost $hi
}
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
Global settings concerns the main behaviour of the daemon.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic fib-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns \&| Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
do not update the Forwarding Information Base, a.k.a. the kernel routing
table.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Op Ic no
.Ic redistribute
.Sm off
.Po Ic static Ns \&| Ns Ic connected Ns \&| Ns
.Ic default Pc
.Sm on
.Xc
.It Xo
.Op Ic no
.Ic redistribute Ar prefix
.Xc
.It Xo
.Op Ic no
.Ic redistribute rtlabel Ar label
.Xc
If set to
.Ic connected ,
routes to directly attached networks will be
announced over RIP.
If set to
.Ic static ,
static routes will be announced over RIP.
If set to
.Ic default ,
a default route pointing to this router will be announced over RIP.
It is possible to specify a network range with
.Ar prefix ;
networks need to be part of that range to be redistributed.
Additionally it is possible to redistribute based on route labels
using the
.Ic rtlabel
keyword.
By default no additional routes will be announced over RIP.
.Pp
.Ic redistribute
statements are evaluated in sequential order, from first to last.
The first matching rule decides if a route should be redistributed or not.
Matching rules starting with
.Ic no
will force the route to be not announced.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic split-horizon
.Sm off
.Po Ic default Ns \&| Ns Ic poisoned Ns \&| Ns
.Ic none Pc
.Sm on
.Xc
If set to
.Ic default ,
do not redistribute routes to the interface from which they were learned.
If set to
.Ic poisoned ,
redistribute routes to the interface from which they were learned, by
forcing the metric to infinity.
Both these behaviours can resolve routing loops when a router goes down.
The default is
.Ic none .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic triggered-updates
.Pq Ic yes Ns \&| Ns Ic no
.Xc
Immediately trigger responses when a route changes.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.El
.Sh INTERFACES
Each interface can have several parameters configured individually, otherwise
they are inherited.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
interface em0 {
}
.Ed
.Pp
Interface-specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic auth-key Ar key
Set the authentication key for
.Ic simple
authentication.
Up to 16 characters can be specified.
.It Ic auth-md Ar key-id key
Set the authentication
.Ar key-id
and
.Ar key
for
.Ic crypt
authentication.
The valid range for
.Ar key-id
is 0\-255.
Up to 16 characters can be specified for
.Ar key .
Multiple keys may be specified.
.It Ic auth-md-keyid Ar key-id
Configure the
.Ar key-id
to use for
.Ic crypt
authentication.
The valid range for
.Ar key-id
is 0\-255.
The default key-id is 1.
.It Xo
.Ic auth-type
.Po Ic none Ns \&| Ns
.Ic simple Ns \&| Ns Ic crypt Pc
.Xc
Set the authentication type.
The default is
.Ic none .
Simple authentication uses a plaintext password, up to 16 characters.
Crypt authentication uses an MD5 hash.
.It Ic cost Ar number
Cost of the network connected through this interface.
Values must be between 1 and 16, inclusive.
.It Ic demote Ar group
Increase the
.Xr carp 4
demotion counter by 1 on the given interface group, usually
.Ar carp ,
when the interface state is going down.
The demotion counter will be decreased when the interface
state is active again.
.It Ic passive
Prevent transmission and reception of LDP packets on this interface.
